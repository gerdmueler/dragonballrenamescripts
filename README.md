# Dragon Ball rename scripts
Scripts to rename and reorganize the 153 Dragon Ball Episodes into folders and either Sagas or Aired Order.
Based on [thetvdb](https://thetvdb.com/series/dragon-ball#seasons).

The script assumes this naming convention: `Dragon Ball S01EXXX.mkv`.
If your files are in a different naming format, you can either rename your files or modify the script.
If you want to test it before modifying your precious files, use the "create_dummies" script to create 153 dummy files you can try the scripts on.

### Pre-requisites
None. You just need Windows and your episodes (technically wit the create_dummies script, you don't even need those).

## How To
1. Decide if you want your episodes organized by Aired Order (6 Seasons) or Sagas (9 Seasons). You can look at them on [thetvdb](https://thetvdb.com/series/dragon-ball#seasons).
2. Download the matching script (rename_aired-order for Aired Order or rename_sagas for Sagas).
3. Run the script and enter the path to your episodes or the dummies if you want to test it first.

### To-Do
If I'm bored enough, I might make Linux versions of the script but my assumption is that anyone who uses Linux can rework the windows scripts in a few minutes.
